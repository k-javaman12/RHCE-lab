---

**[Cut to Host on Screen]**

**Host:**

> "Hey everyone! Welcome back to our Ansible Tutorial Series. I’m [Your Name], and today we’re diving into an exciting part of our journey—setting up a complete PHP and Apache environment on web servers, and configuring HAProxy for load balancing. We’ll use Ansible roles from Galaxy to automate this process across multiple hosts."
> 

> "By the end of this video, you’ll have a fully automated way to deploy PHP and Apache on your web servers and configure HAProxy to manage traffic across them. So, let’s jump in!"
>

### **1. Creating the Playbook File for PHP, Apache, and HAProxy**

### **1.1. Create the Playbook `site.yml`**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "We’ll begin by creating the main playbook file called site.yml. This playbook will handle the installation and configuration of PHP, Apache, and HAProxy across your web servers and load balancers. Open the playbook file in your terminal using your preferred text editor."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
vi /home/vagrant/ansible/site.yml

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Once you have the file open, we’ll start by defining the configuration for the web servers."
>

### **2. Writing the Playbook for Web Servers**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Let’s begin by configuring our web servers. We’re going to use the geerlingguy.php and geerlingguy.apache roles to install and configure PHP and Apache. In addition, we’ll deploy a simple PHP info page to verify the setup. Here’s the content to add for the web servers section:"
> 

**[Display Playbook Content with Syntax Highlighting for Web Servers]:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Configure PHP on Web Servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: geerlingguy.php
      vars:
        php_packages:
          - php
          - php-cli
          - php-common
          - php-devel
          - php-mbstring
          - php-pear
          - php-gd
          - php-xml
          - php-mysqlnd
    - role: geerlingguy.apache
      vars:
        apache_listen_port: 80

  tasks:
    - name: Deploy PHP info page
      copy:
        content: "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
        dest: /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: '0644'
        
- name: Install and Configure HAProxy on Load Balancers
  hosts: balancers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: geerlingguy.haproxy
      vars:
        haproxy_backend_servers:
          - name: web1
            address: 192.168.56.203
            port: 80
```

### **2.1. Explanation of the Web Servers Configuration**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Let’s break this down:"
> 
- **`hosts: webservers`**:
    - This targets the `webservers` group, ensuring PHP and Apache are configured on those hosts.
- **`become: true`**:
    - This ensures that all tasks in this playbook are run with elevated privileges (using `sudo`), which is necessary for installing packages and managing configuration files.
- **Roles**:
    - **`geerlingguy.php`**: This role installs PHP and related packages, including extensions such as `php-mysqlnd` and `php-mbstring`, which are commonly used in PHP applications.
    - **`geerlingguy.apache`**: This role installs and configures Apache, setting it up to listen on port 80 for HTTP traffic.
- **Deploying a PHP info page**:
    - We use the `copy` module to create a PHP file (`phpinfo.php`) in the `/var/www/html/` directory. This file outputs PHP configuration details, making it useful for verifying our PHP setup.
    - The file is owned by the `apache` user and group, with permissions set to `0644`, ensuring it’s readable by the web server.

### **3. Configuring HAProxy on Load Balancers**

### **3.1. Add HAProxy Configuration to the Playbook**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Next, let’s configure HAProxy on our load balancers. HAProxy will balance traffic between multiple web servers. We’ll use the geerlingguy.haproxy role to automate this setup."
> 

**[Display Playbook Content with Syntax Highlighting for HAProxy]:**

```yaml
- name: Install and Configure HAProxy on Load Balancers
  hosts: balancers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: geerlingguy.haproxy
      vars:
        haproxy_backend_servers:
          - name: web1
            address: 192.168.56.203
            port: 80

```

### **3.2. Explanation of HAProxy Configuration**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Let’s break this down:"
> 
- **`hosts: balancers`**:
    - This targets the `balancers` group, which typically includes servers designated for load balancing tasks.
- **`role: geerlingguy.haproxy`**:
    - This role installs and configures HAProxy. It automatically manages the HAProxy service and sets up the basic configuration to balance traffic between backend web servers.
- **`haproxy_backend_servers`**:
    - This variable defines the backend web servers that HAProxy will forward traffic to. In this case, it sends traffic to `web1` at `192.168.56.203` on port 80. You can add more servers here if you have additional web servers.

### **4. Running the Playbook**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Now that we’ve set up the playbook, we can run it using the ansible-playbook command to apply the configurations across all managed nodes."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
ansible-playbook /home/vagrant/ansible/site.yml

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Ansible will now connect to the webservers and balancers groups, install the necessary software, and configure everything according to the roles we defined."
> 

---

### **5. Verifying the Setup**

### **5.1. Verify PHP and Apache Configuration**

**[Cut to Web Browser Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Once the playbook has finished running, let’s verify that our setup is working. Open a web browser and navigate to one of the web servers. In this case, we’ll use the IP 192.168.56.203."
> 

**[Type the URL on Screen and Navigate]:**

```bash
<http://192.168.56.203/phpinfo.php>

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "If everything was configured correctly, you should see a PHP info page displaying details about the PHP environment on the web server."
> 

---

### **5.2. Verify HAProxy Configuration**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "To check if HAProxy is properly configured and balancing traffic, you can test the load balancer by sending requests to the load balancer’s IP address and verifying that traffic is forwarded to your web servers."
>

### **6. Why Use Roles for Web Server and Load Balancer Setup?**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Before we wrap up, let’s quickly discuss why using Ansible roles for setting up web servers and load balancers is so beneficial."
> 

**[Transition to Slide: "Why Use Roles for Server Automation?"]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Here are some key reasons to use roles in your automation process:"
> 

**[Bullet Points on Screen]:**

1. **Modularity**:
    - Roles break down complex setups into modular components, making it easier to manage and reuse tasks across multiple projects.
2. **Reusability**:
    - By using predefined roles from Ansible Galaxy, such as the `geerlingguy.php`, `geerlingguy.apache`, and `geerlingguy.haproxy` roles, you can automate complex setups without writing everything from scratch.
3. **Scalability**:
    - Roles allow you to easily scale your configurations across multiple servers. Whether you’re deploying one or a hundred web servers, the process remains the same.
4. **Consistency**:
    - Using roles ensures that configurations are applied consistently across all servers, reducing the chances of manual errors.
