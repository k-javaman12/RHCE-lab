```yaml
---
- name: Install PHP and MariaDB on webservers group
  hosts:
    - webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install PHP and MariaDB
      yum:
        name:
          - php
          - mariadb-server
        state: latest

- name: Install Development Tools on dev hosts
  hosts: dev
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install RPM Development Tools group
      yum:
        name: "@Development Tools"
        state: present

    - name: Update all packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

```

---

### **3. Explanation of Playbook Components**

### **3.1. Play 1: Install PHP and MariaDB**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "In the first play, we’re targeting the dev, test, and prod hosts. Using the yum module, we install the latest versions of PHP and MariaDB on these hosts."
> 

**[Zoom in on the following snippet]:**

```yaml
- name: Install PHP and MariaDB on webservers group
  hosts:
    - webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install PHP and MariaDB
      yum:
        name:
          - php
          - mariadb-server
        state: latest

```

- **`hosts`**: This targets the `dev`, `test`, and `prod` groups, ensuring the task runs on all the servers in these environments.
- **`become: true`**: This ensures that the tasks are executed with elevated privileges (root) using `sudo`.
- **`tasks`**:
    - **Install PHP and MariaDB**: The `yum` module installs the PHP interpreter and MariaDB server. The `state: latest` ensures that the latest versions are always installed.

### **3.2. Play 2: Install Development Tools on dev Hosts**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "The second play focuses on the dev hosts. We’re installing a group of development tools using the yum module and ensuring that all packages are updated to their latest versions."
> 

**[Zoom in on the following snippet]:**

```yaml
- name: Install Development Tools on dev hosts
  hosts: dev
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install RPM Development Tools group
      yum:
        name: "@Development Tools"
        state: present

    - name: Update all packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

```

- **`hosts`**: This play targets only the `dev` environment.
- **Install RPM Development Tools**:
    - This task installs a group of packages collectively known as **Development Tools**. These include essential tools for compiling code (e.g., `gcc`, `make`).
    - The `state: present` ensures that this group is installed without forcing updates if already installed.
- **Update all packages**:
    - The second task in this play uses `yum` to update all installed packages (`name: '*'`) to their latest versions, ensuring the system is up-to-date.

### **4. Running the Playbook**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Now that we’ve created the playbook, let’s run it and see it in action. We’ll use the ansible-playbook command to execute the packages.yml playbook."
> 

```bash
ansible-playbook /home/vagrant/ansible/packages.yml

```

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

---

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Ansible will now connect to the specified hosts, install the required packages, and update the system. Let’s take a look at the expected output."
> 

---

**[Transition to Playbook Output]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "As you can see, Ansible successfully installed PHP and MariaDB on all the dev, test, and prod hosts, and installed the Development Tools on the dev hosts."
> 

**[Show Expected Output on Screen]:**

```bash
PLAY [Install PHP and MariaDB on dev, test, prod hosts] *************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ************************************************************
ok: [dev]
ok: [test]
ok: [prod]

TASK [Install PHP and MariaDB] ***************************************************
changed: [dev]
changed: [test]
changed: [prod]

PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************
dev                        : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
test                       : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
prod                       : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0

PLAY [Install Development Tools on dev hosts] ***********************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ************************************************************
ok: [dev]

TASK [Install RPM Development Tools group] **************************************
changed: [dev]

TASK [Update all packages] *******************************************************
changed: [dev]

PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************
dev                        : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0

```

- **`ok`**: The task was already in the desired state or successfully executed.
- **`changed`**: The task made changes on the host (e.g., installed a package).
- **`failed`**: Indicates that no tasks failed, which means the playbook ran successfully.

> 

```bash
vagrant ssh node1
php -v
mysql --version

```

**[Type and Execute the Commands on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "You should see the versions of PHP and MariaDB displayed on the terminal, confirming that the installation was successful."
> 

---

### **5.2. Verify Development Tools on `dev` Host**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "For the development hosts, let’s check if the Development Tools group was installed. SSH into the dev host and verify that essential tools like gcc and make are available."
> 

```bash

### **6. Best Practices and Recommendations**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Before we wrap up, here are some best practices for managing packages with Ansible."
> 

**[Transition to Slide: "Best Practices"]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Keep these tips in mind to ensure a smooth experience with Ansible."
> 

**[Bullet Points on Screen]:**

1. **Use Ansible Roles**:
    - Organize your tasks into roles for better modularity and reuse across playbooks. Create roles for packages like web servers, databases, and development tools.
2. **Secure SSH Keys**:
    - Ensure that SSH keys are stored securely, using correct permissions (`chmod 600`) and avoid hardcoding sensitive data in your playbooks.
3. **Use Ansible Vault**:
    - Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and secret URLs using [Ansible Vault]([https://docs.ansible.com](https://docs.ansible.com/)

/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) to secure your playbooks.

1. **Idempotency**:
    - Ensure your playbooks are **idempotent**, meaning running them multiple times will not cause unintended changes. Ansible excels at ensuring consistency by applying changes only when necessary.
2. **Version Control**:
    - Store your playbooks under version control (e.g., Git), so you can track changes and collaborate easily with your team.
