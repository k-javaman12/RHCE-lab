### **2. Disable Secure Boot (If Enabled)**

**[Cut to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Before we proceed, it's important to disable Secure Boot on your machine. This step ensures that VirtualBox can function correctly. Here's how to do it."
> 

**[Cut to Screen Recording: BIOS/UEFI Settings]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "1. Reboot your machine."
> 
> 
> *"2. Enter BIOS/UEFI settings by pressing F2, F10, Delete, or the key specified by your manufacturer during startup."*
> 
> *"3. Navigate to the Secure Boot settings and disable it."*
> 
> *"4. Save your changes and reboot."*
> 

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "With Secure Boot disabled, we're ready to move on to updating our system."

### **3. Update Your System**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "First, let's ensure that all your system packages are up-to-date. Open your terminal and run the following command:"
> 

```bash
sudo dnf update -y

```

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "This command updates all installed packages to their latest versions."
> 

---

### **4. Install Development Tools and Kernel Headers**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Next, we need to install some essential development tools and kernel headers. These are necessary for building VirtualBox kernel modules."
> 

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Run the following command to install the required packages:"
> 

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc make perl kernel-devel kernel-headers

```

When you run the command `sudo dnf install -y gcc make perl kernel-devel kernel-headers`, you are:

- Installing `gcc`, `make`, and `perl` to compile software from source code.
- Installing `kernel-devel` and `kernel-headers` to ensure you can build kernel modules, which is necessary for tools like VirtualBox to interact with the Linux kernel.

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Once the installation is complete, it's a good practice to reboot the system to apply the changes."
> 

```bash
sudo reboot

```

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

**[System Reboots]**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "After rebooting, let's verify that the kernel headers match our current running kernel version. This step is crucial for ensuring compatibility."
> 

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Check your kernel version with:"
> 

```bash
uname -r

```

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "For example, if your kernel version is 5.14.0-427.13.1.el9_4.x86_64, make sure to install the corresponding kernel-devel and kernel-headers packages:"
> 

```bash
sudo dnf install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r)

```

### **5. Installing Vagrant via DNF**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Now, let's install Vagrant using the DNF package manager. We'll add the HashiCorp repository to ensure we get the latest version."
> 

What is Vagrant?

Vagrant is a powerful tool for managing development environments through virtualization, making it particularly useful for setting up consistent environments in this tutorial. However, as development practices evolve towards containerization and microservices architectures, tools like Docker offer greater efficiency, speed, and flexibility, leading to a shift in preference for container-based solutions over traditional VM-based setups. But for the practice, Weâ€™re going to use Vagrant.

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "First, add the HashiCorp repository:"
> 

```bash
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo <https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo>

```

**[Type and Execute the Commands on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Then, install Vagrant:"
> 

```bash
sudo dnf install -y vagrant

```

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "This method ensures you have the latest Vagrant version without the hassle of manual RPM downloads."

- Each node has its own **IP address**, **hostname**, and **memory allocation**.
- The script is automated to configure the VMs, install necessary tools, and avoid repeating code for each node.
