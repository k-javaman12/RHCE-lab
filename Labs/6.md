**Host:**

> "Hey everyone! Welcome back to our Ansible Tutorial Series. I’m [Your Name], and in this video, we’re going to automate the process of configuring SELinux across your managed nodes using Ansible. SELinux is crucial for securing Linux systems, but managing it across multiple hosts manually can be time-consuming. That’s where Ansible comes in to help simplify the process. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have your SELinux policies configured and enforced with just one playbook. Let’s dive right in!"
>

### **1. Setting Up the Playbook to Configure SELinux**

### **1.1. Create the Playbook File**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "To start, we’ll create our playbook file. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you store your Ansible playbooks. I’ll use the vi text editor to create a new playbook file called selinux.yml in the /home/admin/ansible directory."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
vi /home/vagrant/ansible/selinux.yml

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "You can use any text editor of your choice, such as nano, vim, or code depending on your setup."
>

### **1.2. Playbook Content**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Next, we’ll write the playbook that will configure SELinux on all managed hosts. Here’s the content you’ll insert into the selinux.yml file."
> 

**[Display Playbook Content with Syntax Highlighting]:**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure SELinux on all hosts
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    selinux_policy: targeted
    selinux_state: enforcing
  roles:
    - rhel-system-roles.selinux

```

---

### **Explaining the Playbook**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Let’s break down what this playbook does."
> 

**[Zoom in on the Playbook Section-by-Section]:**

1. **Playbook Name and Hosts**:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Configure SELinux on all hosts
      hosts: all
      become: true
    
    ```
    
    - **`name`**: Provides a description of the playbook's purpose, in this case, configuring SELinux across all hosts.
    - **`hosts: all`**: This indicates that the playbook will target **all hosts** in the inventory. This is ideal for managing large numbers of machines.
    - **`become: true`**: Ensures that the playbook runs with elevated privileges (i.e., `sudo`) since modifying SELinux requires root access.
2. **Variables for SELinux Configuration**:
    
    ```yaml
    vars:
      selinux_policy: targeted
      selinux_state: enforcing
    
    ```
    
    - **`selinux_policy`**: This defines the SELinux policy to apply. In this example, it’s set to `targeted`, which is the default policy for most systems. It confines specific processes while allowing others to operate freely.
    - **`selinux_state`**: This variable sets SELinux to `enforcing` mode, ensuring that all security policies are strictly applied.
3. **Role Definition**:
    
    ```yaml
    roles:
      - rhel-system-roles.selinux
    
    ```
    
    - **`roles`**: We are using a predefined role from the `rhel-system-roles` collection, specifically the `selinux` role. This role simplifies the process by automating the configuration of SELinux policies and states based on the variables defined in the playbook.

### **2. Running the Playbook to Configure SELinux**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Once the playbook is set up, we’ll execute it to apply the SELinux configurations across all managed nodes. To run the playbook, use the ansible-playbook command."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
ansible-playbook selinux.yml

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "This command tells Ansible to run the selinux.yml playbook, applying the configurations to all hosts defined in your inventory."
> 

---

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**

> "Once the playbook starts running, Ansible will connect to each host, apply the SELinux configuration, and enforce the targeted policy. Now, let’s verify that the SELinux settings have been correctly applied."
> 

---

### **3. Verifying the SELinux Configuration**

### **3.1. Check SELinux Status on a Host**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "To check the status of SELinux on one of your hosts, SSH into it. For this example, I’ll connect to one of my nodes at 192.168.56.201."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
ssh vagrant@192.168.56.201
getenforce

```

**Expected Output**:

```bash
Enforcing

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "The getenforce command checks the current SELinux mode. If the playbook applied correctly, the output should be Enforcing, meaning SELinux is actively enforcing security policies on the system."
> 

---

### **3.2. Check the SELinux Policy**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**

> "Next, let’s verify that the correct SELinux policy is applied. The sestatus command will give us this information."
> 

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
sestatus | grep "Loaded policy name"

```

**Expected Output**:

```bash
Loaded policy name: targeted

```

**Host Voiceover:**

> "The sestatus command reports the overall status of SELinux. By using grep, we can filter the output to show the SELinux policy, which should be targeted as defined in our playbook."
>

### **Additional Tips for Your YouTube Video:**

1. **Visual Clarity**:
    - Use clear and high-resolution screen recordings, with zoom-ins and annotations to highlight key commands and outputs.
    - When showing terminal output, ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
2. **Pacing**:
    - Maintain a steady pace throughout the video, giving viewers enough time to follow along. Consider brief pauses between commands to let viewers try them in their environment.
3. **Engagement**:
    - Encourage viewers to share their own experiences with managing SELinux across their infrastructure. This builds a sense of community around your content and helps others learn from shared experiences.
4. **Annotations and Callouts**:
    - Use on-screen annotations to point out important aspects of the playbook and terminal commands. This helps reinforce what’s being discussed in the voiceover.
5. **Audio and Music**:
    - Balance background music

with voiceover audio to ensure clarity. Background music should be subtle and not overpower the narration.

1. **Consistency**:
    - Keep the format consistent with your previous videos in the series, including the intro and outro animations, background music, and font choices. This creates a cohesive viewing experience for your audience.
2. **Provide Links**:
    - Include links to relevant Ansible documentation, GitHub repositories, or related tutorials in the video description for viewers who want to explore further.

With these refinements, your sixth video in the Ansible series will provide a clear, engaging tutorial on automating SELinux configuration across multiple hosts. Viewers will appreciate the practical approach and gain valuable skills in Ansible automation!
