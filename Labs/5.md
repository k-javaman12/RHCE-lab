**Host:**
> *"Hey everyone! Welcome back to our Ansible Tutorial Series. I’m [Your Name], and in this fifth part of the series, we’re going to level up our playbooks by adding variables and handlers. We’ll use these techniques to efficiently install and manage the Apache web server across multiple environments. By the end of this video, you’ll be able to create flexible and reusable playbooks that scale with your infrastructure. Let’s get started!"*

### **1. Overview of the Original Playbook**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"In our previous videos, we set up a basic Ansible playbook to install and start Apache on our web servers. Here’s a quick look at the original playbook:"*

**[Show the Original Playbook on Screen with Syntax Highlighting]:**

```yaml
---
- name: Setup Apache on all webservers
  hosts:
    - webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"This playbook does the job, but today we’re going to refine it to make it more flexible, scalable, and maintainable. Let’s dive into how we can enhance this playbook with variables, notifications, and handlers."*

---

### **2. Enhanced Playbook with Variables and Handlers**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"We’ll start by adding variables to our playbook to make it easier to modify in the future. Additionally, we’ll use handlers to ensure Apache is restarted only when necessary, optimizing the playbook's performance."*

**[Display the Enhanced Playbook with Syntax Highlighting]:**

```yaml
---
- name: Setup Apache on all webservers
  hosts:
    - webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    apache_package: httpd
    apache_service: httpd
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: "{{ apache_package }}"
        state: present
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: "{{ apache_service }}"
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: "{{ apache_service }}"
        state: restarted
```

---

### **3. Explanation of Enhanced Playbook Components**

#### **3.1. Using Variables for Flexibility**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"In this updated playbook, we’re using the `vars` section to define variables for the Apache package and service name. This allows us to easily modify the playbook if we need to install a different web server, like NGINX, in the future."*

**[Zoom in on the Variables Section]:**

```yaml
vars:
  apache_package: httpd
  apache_service: httpd
```

- **`apache_package`**: The name of the Apache package (can be easily changed for different distributions or web servers).
- **`apache_service`**: The name of the Apache service (again, modifiable if you switch to a different web server).

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"With these variables in place, the playbook becomes more dynamic and reusable across different setups."*

---

#### **3.2. Task Notifications and Handlers**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"Next, we’ve introduced a powerful feature in Ansible: **handlers**. Handlers are special tasks that are triggered only when a task changes the state of the system. In our case, Apache will only be restarted if the package was installed or updated."*

**[Zoom in on the Task and Handler Section]:**

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: "{{ apache_package }}"
      state: present
    notify:
      - Restart Apache
```

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"This task notifies a handler to restart Apache if there’s any change, such as installing or upgrading the package. The handler then runs at the end of the playbook execution."*

**[Zoom in on the Handler Section]:**

```yaml
handlers:
  - name: Restart Apache
    service:
      name: "{{ apache_service }}"
      state: restarted
```

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"This handler ensures that Apache is restarted only if necessary, making the playbook more efficient and avoiding unnecessary restarts."*

---

### **4. Running the Enhanced Playbook**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"Now, let’s run the enhanced playbook and see how it performs across our web servers. To do this, we’ll execute the playbook with the updated inventory."*

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
ansible-playbook -i /home/vagrant/ansible/inventory /home/vagrant/ansible/setup_webservers.yml
```

---

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**
> *"Ansible will now connect to each server, install Apache, and ensure it’s running. Since we’ve added handlers, Apache will only restart if the installation process made changes. Let’s take a look at the expected output."*

---

### **5. Expected Playbook Output**

**[Show the Expected Playbook Output on Screen]:**

```bash
PLAY [Setup Apache on all webservers] *****************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [node3.ansi.example.com]
ok: [node4.ansi.example.com]

TASK [Install Apache] *********************************************************
changed: [node3.ansi.example.com]
changed: [node4.ansi.example.com]

TASK [Ensure Apache is running] ***********************************************
ok: [node3.ansi.example.com]
ok: [node4.ansi.example.com]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
node3.ansi.example.com     : ok=3    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
node4.ansi.example.com     : ok=3    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"As we can see from the output, the `changed` status indicates that Apache was installed, and `ok` shows that Apache was already running. Because the task installed Apache, the handler will automatically restart it at the end of the playbook execution."*

---

### **6. Verifying Ansible Connectivity with a Ping Test**

**[Cut to Terminal Screen Recording]**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"After running the playbook, it’s a good idea to verify that Ansible can communicate with all the managed nodes in your inventory. We’ll use the `ping` module to ensure everything is set up correctly."*

**[Type and Execute the Command on Screen]:**

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

---

**[Show the Expected Output of the Ping Test on Screen]:**

```bash
node1.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node2.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node3.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node4.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
repo.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
control.ansi.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"The `SUCCESS` message from each host confirms that Ansible can communicate with them, and they are ready for future automation tasks."*

### **7. Best Practices for Playbook Optimization**

**[Cut Back to Host]**

**Host:**
> *"Before we wrap up, here are some best practices to keep in mind when creating more advanced Ansible playbooks like the one we’ve built today."*

**[Transition to Slide: "Best Practices for Playbook Optimization"]**

**Host Voiceover:**
> *"These tips will help you create playbooks that are not only functional but also scalable and maintainable."*

**[Bullet Points on Screen]:**

1. **Use Variables**:
   - Always use variables for package names, service names, or paths. This makes your playbooks reusable across different environments or configurations.
  
2. **Leverage Handlers**:
   - Use handlers to restart or reload services only when necessary. This improves playbook performance and avoids unnecessary actions.

3. **Notify for Changes**:
   - Implement the `notify` directive to trigger handlers based on task results. This allows you to manage system states efficiently.

4. **Test Playbooks in Stages**:
   - Break down complex playbooks into smaller tasks and test each section independently before running it on production servers.

5. **Maintain Idempotency**:
   - Ensure your playbooks are idempotent. Running them multiple times should not cause changes unless necessary, making the playbook predictable and reliable.
